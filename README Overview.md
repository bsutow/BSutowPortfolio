# Brett Sutow's Github Portfolio 
The overall goal of this portfolio is to showcase my skills as an expert in analytics, visualization, data science, and code writing.
Throughout the files you will see various different projects.They show off various different skills in the field. 
As a Masters student in data science at Bellevue University, I was able to develop and grow my skills within this field. 
Within each of the folders there will be a READ ME file explaining the overall goals and concepts of what the data is explaining.
