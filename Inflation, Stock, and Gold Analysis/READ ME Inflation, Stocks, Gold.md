Inflation, Stock, and Gold Analysis

This file showcases my skills in data analysis comparing that of inflation, stocks, and gold. 
The overall point of this project was to see how these three items compare to one another. 
In by doing this we could create a better overall analysis which allowed us to gain a stronger understanding for investments.
This analysis proved to be very valuable during this time period in which these markets have much uncertainity.
