MLB Project

This project utilizes visualizations and data analysis to show various changes over an MLB players career.
The overall goal of this project was to analyze the best players and see where exactly their careers peaked. 
Through this analysis we were able to see that these superstars actually had two peaks in their careers.
The reason for this analysis is to better allow us an understanding on how to properly value players throughout their careers.
By doing this it allows us with a better understanding on contract going forward.
