Airline Project
This project highlights my skills in the R, Python, and Tableau. I had the opportunity to analyze various different travel data. 
In by doing so I was able to create a few different visualizations which finalized in a PowerPoint and infographic. 
This analysis proves that airlines are in fact the safest form of travel when you are going on a trip or vacation. 
My analysis and graphics prove this, and I back them up in facts in research.
